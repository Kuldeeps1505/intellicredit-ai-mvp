> *"India's corporate loan process takes 3–6 weeks and costs banks ₹80,000 per appraisal. We built IntelliCredit AI — an India Stack-native credit intelligence platform with 7 autonomous AI agents that ingests data via the Account Aggregator network, reconciles GSTR-2A vs GSTR-3B for fraud detection, computes buyer concentration risk from GSTR-1, and outputs a fully explainable Credit Appraisal Memo in 4 minutes — including counterfactual reasoning: exactly what the borrower needs to change to get approved. No Indian credit tool does this today."*

## Setup & Deployment

### Docker Compose

1. Create env file:
   `cp .env.example .env`
2. Start the stack:
   `docker compose up --build -d`
3. Seed demo applications:
   `docker compose run --rm --profile seed seed`
4. Open the app:
   `http://localhost:3000`

### Services

- `web`: Vite React frontend
- `api`: FastAPI application server
- `worker`: background pipeline runner
- `postgres`: primary relational database
- `redis`: queue + transient session state
- `minio`: object storage for uploaded/generated documents
- `chromadb`: optional retrieval/vector store dependency

### Demo Mode Env Requirements

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is optional for booting the stack and seeded demo flows
- `SANDBOX_API_KEY` and `TAVILY_API_KEY` are optional in demo mode
- live external-agent behavior will be limited until those credentials are supplied

## 🚨 The Problem

India's banking system processes corporate credit applications manually. Bank credit officers spend **3–6 weeks** gathering and computing data that an AI system can process in **4 minutes**.

### The Data Paradox
- Fintechs process **8,500+ data points** per loan application using AI
- Bank credit managers still do it **manually** — 3–6 weeks per application
- Cost: **₹80,000 per appraisal** for mid/large corporate loans
- Hidden risks (ITC fraud, buyer concentration, promoter NPA linkages) go undetected
- India's Gross NPA for large corporates: **~3.5%** per RBI data — worth billions in undetected risk

### What Existing Tools Cannot Do

| Tool | What They Do | What They Miss |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **CIBIL** | Historical bureau data | No real-time GST intelligence |
| **Crediwatch** | Firmographic + news data | No GST invoice-level analysis |
| **Perfios** | Bank statement analysis | Cannot reconcile GSTR-2A vs GSTR-3B |
| **All of the above** | Partial views | No counterfactual explainability |

---

## 💡 Our Solution

IntelliCredit AI is a **7-agent AI pipeline** that takes raw documents or Account Aggregator consent-pulled data and produces a complete, explainable **Credit Appraisal Memo (CAM) in under 4 minutes**.

### India Stack Integration
- **Account Aggregator (AA) Framework** — borrower approves consent on their AA app; bank statements, GST returns, and ITR data are pulled automatically. No manual uploads needed.
- **Sandbox.co.in API** — live, GSTN-authorized access to GSTR-1, GSTR-2A, GSTR-3B, and GSTIN verification
- **RBI-compliant design** — explainable Logistic Regression scorecard, audit-ready Chain of Evidence provenance

### Output — Credit Appraisal Memo (CAM)
- 8-section structured report: company overview, financial analysis, Five-Cs assessment, GSTR reconciliation, buyer concentration risk, counterfactual recommendations, Chain of Evidence appendix
- Every figure links back to its **exact source**: document name, page number, extraction method, confidence score
- Downloadable as professional **PDF** and **DOCX**
- Generated in **< 4 minutes** vs 3–6 weeks manually




## 🤖 The 7-Agent Pipeline

Orchestrated by **LangGraph** as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Agents 2, 3 and both Engines run **concurrently** after Agent 1 completes.

---

## 🔬 Innovation Highlights

### 1. GSTR-2A vs GSTR-3B Reconciliation Engine ⭐

> **No Indian credit tool offers this capability today.**

**What it checks:**
- **GSTR-2A** = auto-populated from your *suppliers'* invoices filed with GSTN — what your suppliers declared they sold you
- **GSTR-3B** = *self-declared* by the borrower — what they claim as Input Tax Credit
- Discrepancy between the two = **ITC fraud signal**

**Implementation:**
- Pulls GSTR-2A and GSTR-3B data from Sandbox.co.in API
- Computes quarter-by-quarter reconciliation waterfall
- Flags `ITC_FRAUD_SUSPECTED` (CRITICAL) if variance > 10%
- Flags `OUTPUT_SUPPRESSION_SUSPECTED` if GSTR-1 doesn't match GSTR-3B outward supplies

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "quarters": [
    { "q": "Q1 FY24", "gstr2a": 48.3, "gstr3b_itc_claimed": 61.2, "variance": 12.9, "flag": true }
  ],
  "total_suspect_itc": 28.4,
  "flag": "ITC_FRAUD_SUSPECTED",
  "severity": "CRITICAL"
}
```

---

### 2. Buyer Concentration Engine (GSTR-1 Counterparty Analysis) ⭐

> **Even Perfios and Crediwatch with full bank statement analysis cannot compute this — they don't have access to GST invoice-level counterparty data.**

**What it does:**
- GSTR-1 contains every B2B invoice the borrower raised, including the **buyer's GSTIN**
- We aggregate by buyer GSTIN to compute **revenue concentration**

**Flags:**
- `HIGH_BUYER_CONCENTRATION` — if top 3 buyers > 60% of revenue
- `SINGLE_BUYER_DEPENDENCY` (CRITICAL) — if single buyer > 40% of revenue

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "top_buyers": [
    { "gstin": "29XXXXX", "name": "Buyer A Ltd", "revenue_pct": 71.2 }
  ],
  "top3_concentration": 82.4,
  "flag": "SINGLE_BUYER_DEPENDENCY",
  "severity": "CRITICAL"
}
```

---

### 3. Counterfactual Explainability Engine ⭐

> **No Indian credit tool provides this. It answers: "Exactly what must this borrower change to get approved?"**

For **rejected or conditional** applications, the engine computes the **minimum changes** required to cross the APPROVE threshold (score > 75). Steps are ordered by ease of implementation.

**Example Counterfactuals:**
```
REJECTED — Score: 28/100 | Approve Threshold: 75 | Gap: 47 points

Path to Approval:
  Priority 1: Resolve ₹12.9Cr ITC discrepancy with GSTN
  Priority 2: Resolve NCLT petition ₹4.2Cr (Case #XYZ)
  Priority 3: Reduce D/E from 3.4 → below 2.0
              → Repay ₹18Cr debt OR inject ₹12Cr equity
  Priority 4: Diversify buyer base — reduce top buyer from 71% → below 40%
```

For **approved loans**, shows how close the application was to rejection.

---

### 4. Chain of Evidence — Data Provenance

Every single financial figure in the CAM is **traceable to its exact source**. When the report says "Revenue: ₹120Cr":

```
Document:   Annual Report 2024
Page:        42
Method:      FinBERT NER
Confidence:  97%
Context:     "...total revenue from operations stood at ₹120.3 crores..."
```

Every field is stored in the `field_provenance` table and exposed via the `<CitationBadge />` React component — hover any figure anywhere in the app to see its source.

---

### 5. FinBERT Financial NLP

We use **ProsusAI/finbert** — a BERT model fine-tuned on financial text — instead of generic spaCy NER.

| Model | Domain | Accuracy on Financial Text |
|-------|--------|---------------------------|
| Generic spaCy | General English | ~70% |
| **FinBERT** | Financial documents | **>95%** |

**Extracts:**
- Revenue, EBITDA, Net Profit, Total Debt, Net Worth, Cash from Operations, Total Assets
- Company Name, CIN, PAN, GSTIN, DIN numbers, ₹ amounts (Cr/Lakh normalization)
- Risk-relevant legal phrases: "default", "winding up petition", "NCLT", "wilful defaulter"

---

### 6. Logistic Regression Scorecard (RBI-Preferred)

> **Why not XGBoost?** Logistic Regression is what Indian bank credit scorecards actually use internally. It is fully transparent, auditable, and RBI prefers interpretable models. XGBoost is a black box that regulators do not accept for credit decisions.

**Features:**
```
dscr, de_ratio, revenue_cagr_3y, litigation_count,
industry_outlook_score, buyer_concentration_pct,
gst_reconciliation_variance, promoter_reputation_score
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "default_probability_12m": 47.8,
  "default_probability_24m": 63.2,
  "top_drivers": [
    { "factor": "dscr", "coefficient": -2.4, "direction": "negative" },
    { "factor": "gst_reconciliation_variance", "coefficient": 1.8, "direction": "positive" }
  ]
}
```

## ❓ Judge Q&A

**Q: How is this different from CIBIL / Crediwatch / Perfios?**
> CIBIL uses historical bureau data. Crediwatch and Perfios do bank statement analysis. We are the **only system** that reconciles GSTR-2A vs GSTR-3B for ITC fraud detection AND computes buyer concentration from GSTR-1 invoice counterparty data. No other tool does these two things.

**Q: What if the LLM hallucinates financial figures?**
> Numbers are extracted **deterministically** by pdfplumber + Camelot + FinBERT + Sandbox.co.in API. The LLM only writes narrative sections. Every figure has a **Chain of Evidence citation** linking to source document, page number, extraction method, and confidence score.

**Q: Why Logistic Regression instead of XGBoost?**
> Logistic Regression is what Indian bank credit scorecards **actually use internally**. It is fully transparent, auditable, and RBI prefers interpretable models. XGBoost is a black box that regulators do not accept for credit decisions.

**Q: The eCourts and MCA21 APIs aren't publicly available?**
> For the prototype we use **clearly labeled mock data**. For production, we integrate with Sandbox.co.in (live GSTN-authorized API we use today) and CKYC registry. MCA21 V3 API is in public beta.

**Q: Why Databricks?**
> Our production architecture uses Databricks Delta Lake: **Bronze** (raw ingestion) → **Silver** (cleaned features) → **Gold** (ML-ready credit features). MLflow tracks our scoring model. Databricks Vector Search replaces ChromaDB in production.

**Q: Can this replace credit analysts?**
> No. **70% of analyst time** is data gathering and initial computation — we eliminate that. Analysts focus on judgment, client relationships, and edge cases. We are an **augmentation tool**, not a replacement.
